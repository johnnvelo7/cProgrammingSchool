Good job guys!

Now you have learnt how to get files over the internet with URL.

Practical Session :

Goals:
- Get familiar with linux operating system
- Get comfortable with using terminal
- Get to use several different terminal commands

Tasks:

- Play with tab:
	- Start typing command like 's' and press tab, then type 'u' and tab,
	  then type 'd' and tab
	- Use it to see the possible files
	- go into /etc directory
	- type 'cd' and space and then press tab
- Copy and paste text using mouse in the terminal
	- Use ctrl+shift+c to copy and ctrl+shift+v to paste
	- Use highlighting to copy and middle click to paste

- Mess around with files
	- Look at the structure in /
	- look at the binaries in /bin
	- Try to locate binaries for all the commands we learnt today in the
	  lecture
	- Make a note of the ones you didnt find
- man pages
	- man man
	- read about more commands
	- try to play with the options with safe commands like cd, ls, grep

- Copy the file you downloaded to /var
  ==> cp linux.txt /var
  ("cp: cannot create regular file '/var/linux.txt': Permission denied")

- Try copying with sudo
  ==> sudo cp linux.txt /var

- create a folder in your home directory
  ==> cd ~
      mkdir leksjon1

- go into the folder
  ==> cd leksjon1

- create two text files with your favorite lines in that folder
  ==> Use gedit or other editor.

- concatenate the two files and print the output to the terminal
  ==> cat file1.txt file2.txt

- concatenate and print the output to a third file
  ==> cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt

- Write a small script that takes in two files, concatenates it and puts the
  content into third file and also prints the third file to terminal:

  ==> gedit skript.sh

  #!/bin/sh
  cat $1 $2 > $3
  cat $3

  chmod +x skript.sh

  ./skript.sh file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

- Download a text file from internet - a book in text format
  ==> wget http://www.aspenberg.info/kernighanritchie.txt

- dump the contents of the book in terminal
  ==> cat kernighanritchie.txt

  (Dumps it all)

- open it with less
  ==> less kernighanritchie.txt

  (Use space to page, arrow up, arrow down, Q to quit, same as "man")

- copy the downloaded book into the directory you created.
- search for some word - both case sensitive and insensitive - in the file
  ==> grep "C" kernighanritchie.txt
      grep "[Cc]" kernighanritchie.txt
      grep -i "C" kernighanritchie.txt
      grep -i "ritchie" kernighanritchie.txt

- save all the lines with that word into another file
  ==> grep -i "ritchie" kernighanritchie.txt > liste.txt

- go to /etc and read the contents of the file 'sudoers'
  ==> cd /etc
      cat sudoers  ("Permission denied")

- check for the permissions of that file
  ==> ls -l sudoers
  -r--r----- 1 root root 755 Jan 13  2017 sudoers
  Which means r for own, r for group, none for others.

- try reading it using sudo
  ==> sudo cat sudoers (Will display the file)

- make a symbolic link to your created directory in /tmp
  ==> cd /tmp
      ln -s /home/hka/leksjon1/ test

- cd to your symbolic link
  ==> cd test

- use pwd to know what your current directory is
  ==> pwd  ("/tmp/test")

      hka@westerdals:~$ cd leksjon1/
      hka@westerdals:~/leksjon1$
      hka@westerdals:~/leksjon1$ ls
      file1.txt  file3.txt    kernighanritchie.txt  skript.sh
      file2.txt  fileres.txt  liste.txt
      hka@westerdals:~/leksjon1$ cd /tmp/test
      hka@westerdals:/tmp/test$ ls
      file1.txt  file3.txt    kernighanritchie.txt  skript.sh
      file2.txt  fileres.txt  liste.txt

- try rebooting and finding your symbolic link
  (It's gone as it was created in /tmp)
